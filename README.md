Constrain is a library for probablistic grammar-guided generation. 





Syncode-core is a complete reimplementation of Syncode in the Rust programming language. Its goal is to not depend on any non-Rust logic or components. Adding bindings to Python and other scripting languages is on the roadmap, but the Rust implementation is still incomplete.
## Alternatives
Syncode is far from the only library for constrained generation. Here are a few other projects that do the same thing:
- llguidance
- XGrammar
- GreatGramma
- Outlines
- llama.cpp
